## Description

This is built using Full Stack. We are using the Google Books API to be able to search for books by title and then are able to save those books. You are also able to go to the saved page and it will show you all your saved books and allow you to delete any books you do not want saved.

This mock E-Commerce application is a full stack application build using MySql, Express.js, React.js and Node.js. Other technologies that are used are BCryptjs, JSON Web Token, Multer, Cors,
DotEnv, Nodemailer, Sequelize, Bootstrap, Material Design Bootstrap, Joi Browser, Lodash, React Router, React Toastify, Axios and Jwt Decode. Users can search through our products be either searching by a product name or by a product category. Users can create an account, login and shop for items. Items can be added to a users cart, which is persisted in the MySql database. Users can update their passwords and manage their account information. Users are also able to complete purchases and have a list of their purchases sent to the email they registerd with. The only feature that has not been implemented is an external API to process credit card payments such as Stripe API.

NOTE: This is a mock store. Items listed are not really for sale. All information passed is encrypted by SSL and passwords are hashed on the database. With that said, please don't enter any personal or sensitive information in. Thanks and enjoy!

## Usage

This is a mockup of an E-Commerce store. The only missing piece is a payment API such as stripe.
NOTE: The slow loading times of the application are due to the use of free dynos on Heroku
